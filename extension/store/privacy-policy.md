# Privacy Policy — The Murderer's Lock Browser Extension

**Last updated:** [DATE]

## Overview

The Murderer's Lock browser extension helps you auto-fill passwords from your encrypted vault. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data We Collect

**We do not collect, store, or transmit your passwords or vault contents.**

- **Local storage only:** Vault contents are stored temporarily in your browser's session storage when you unlock your vault. This data is cleared when you close your browser.
- **App URL:** You may configure the URL of your Murderer's Lock app. This is stored locally on your device.
- **No analytics:** We do not use analytics, tracking, or third-party scripts in the extension.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Passwords
- Vault contents
- Browsing history
- Personal information
- Usernames or credentials

## How It Works

1. You unlock your vault in the Murderer's Lock web app.
2. The app sends vault contents to the extension via a message (stays in your browser).
3. The extension stores this in session storage (temporary, cleared on browser close).
4. When you click "Fill" on a login page, the extension inserts the matching password into the form.
5. No data is sent to our servers or any third party.

## Permissions

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `storage` | Store your App URL config and temporary vault contents |
| `activeTab` | Access the current tab to insert fill data |
| `host_permissions` | Inject content script on login pages to show Fill buttons |

## Third Parties

We do not share data with third parties. The extension does not include third-party analytics or tracking.

## Changes

We may update this policy. Changes will be posted at this URL with an updated date.
